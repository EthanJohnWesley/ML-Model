# ML-Model
This project demonstrates the implementation of a machine learning model using Rust, with a focus on decision trees. Rust's performance, safety, and concurrency make it an excellent choice for building high-performance machine learning applications. This project pulls from a heart disease data set and developed off of the coding tutorial: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-machine-learning-model-in-rust/

Key Features:
  Decision Tree Implementation: A robust, custom-built decision tree algorithm for classification and regression tasks.
  Optimized Performance: Leverages Rust's zero-cost abstractions and memory safety to ensure fast and reliable computation.
  Scalable Design: Designed to handle datasets of varying sizes with efficient data management.
  Extensibility: Modular code structure, making it easy to extend to other machine learning algorithms or integrate into larger projects.
